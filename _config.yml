## TODO: napisati opis site-a
description: Do you want to maximize your stay in Zagreb by discovering shortcuts to all the city’s hidden gems? Immerse yourself in the local culture with the help of the insider tips? Learn more about the city’s history and gossipy historical titbits? Then don’t miss out on this engaging 2-hour walking tour around the city centre with a certified guide. To keep the tour tailored just for you, I work only with independent travellers, small groups and families. This way you get a chance to chitchat about the things that really interest you and skip the topics that bore you to tears. So what do you say? These tutoring classes are also for foreigners wanting to learn or perfect their Croatian.
